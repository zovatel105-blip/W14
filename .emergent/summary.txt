The previous AI engineer meticulously debugged and resolved critical issues impacting poll mention displays and implemented logo modifications. Initially, poll mentions weren't visible due to backend 500 errors and authentication problems in . The engineer systematically addressed these by verifying backend services, fixing  to include , and resolving authentication in .

After confirming backend functionality, the focus shifted to frontend rendering. A key discovery was that while general poll mentions were resolved, option-specific mentions were being passed as raw IDs from the backend. The engineer successfully modified  to fully resolve these option-level  into complete user objects, confirming the backend now delivers correct data. The trajectory concludes with the backend functioning perfectly, poised for frontend visual verification of the fix.

The primary objective was to enhance a social polling application by integrating robust social features and improving its UI. This included developing a Social Sharing Panel for user profiles, enabling dynamic management of social links with styled cards and official SVG logos. Key fixes involved resolving User not found errors, ensuring correct post display, and refining the real-time chat system. A significant ongoing task was the poll mention system, requiring mentioned users to appear as avatars in published polls, ensuring accurate display of poll option descriptions, and iteratively refining mention visuals (e.g., dark horizontal banners, combined with descriptions, and finally, as option-specific elements). Additionally, the quick action logo needed to be white, ring-free, and updated with specific user-provided images. The latest focus was on ensuring option-specific mentions are correctly displayed within each poll option's card.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines data structures for the application, including  and .
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes mentioned in the trajectory, but inspected to understand data structures. The  model includes , and  is used for resolved user data.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Contains the core FastAPI application logic, including all API endpoints for polls and users.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Inspected extensively for  and  endpoints.
        -   Modified to correctly resolve  from raw user IDs to full  objects specifically for **option-level mentions** during the  request. This fixed the issue where the frontend was receiving IDs instead of resolved user data for option mentions (identified around line 4207).

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles API communication with the backend for poll-related operations and transforms data for the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  to ensure that  arrays for individual poll options are correctly passed through from the backend response. This was a prerequisite for the frontend to attempt displaying them.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Renders the main feed of polls that users see.
    -   **Changes**: Previously had authentication logic temporarily commented out to debug poll loading, which was later resolved. Inspected to confirm polls are loading.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Renders an individual poll, including its title, options, and general poll mentions.
    -   **Changes**: Inspected to confirm its role in displaying  at the general poll level and to ensure it delegates option rendering to layout components.

-    and :
    -   **Importance**: These components are responsible for rendering the specific layout of poll options (carousel or grid).
    -   **Changes**: Inspected  and confirmed it was correctly structured to display  *above* the option description. This means the visual display logic was ready, but the data it received was initially incorrect (IDs instead of resolved objects).

-   **Frontend Visual Verification**: Confirm that the backend fix (resolving option-specific mentions) has made the mentions visually appear correctly in the frontend feed within the poll option cards.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully identified and resolved a critical backend issue concerning the display of poll mentions. The core problem was that  at the option level were being returned as raw user IDs by the  endpoint in , instead of fully resolved  objects. This prevented the frontend from rendering them correctly.

The engineer applied a fix to  (specifically around line 4207) to ensure that option-specific  are properly resolved and transformed into complete user objects before being sent to the frontend. This change was verified by re-testing the  endpoint with  after restarting the backend, confirming that the response now includes fully resolved user data for option mentions. The backend is now deemed to be functioning perfectly in terms of providing the correct mention data. The next immediate action is to visually verify this fix on the frontend.
