The previous AI engineer demonstrated a methodical approach to debugging and implementing features in a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The work began with a design enhancement for the authentication page, which then exposed underlying issues like incorrect navigation paths and missing environment variables, all of which were systematically addressed. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on fixing inconsistencies in the follow/unfollow logic across backend endpoints, database models, and frontend rendering, complicated by a backend caching issue. Finally, the AI tackled avatar display logic, ensuring consistency and proper fallback. The current task involves addressing saved posts not displaying on the frontend, where the backend logic has been verified, isolating the remaining work to the frontend. The engineer's process involved careful code exploration, targeted edits, and diligent testing with screenshots and backend API calls, showing strong problem-solving skills in a complex environment.

The user initially requested an improvement to the design of the authentication page. This was clarified to be a modern, minimalist, Instagram/TikTok-like design, mobile-optimized, with new colors and gradients. Following this, the user reported several issues:
1.  Follower/following statistics were not updating correctly on the profile page.
2.  The follow buttons in the feed and profile were not visually updating their state after a successful follow action.
3.  An unwanted placeholder profile picture was appearing in the feed even when no avatar was uploaded by the user.
4.  The default avatar background in the feed needed to be consistent with the profile's avatar background.
5.  Currently, posts saved via the save button do not appear in the saved publications section of the user's profile, despite the save action appearing successful.

So far, the authentication page has been redesigned and its navigation fixed. The backend and frontend logic for follow/unfollow and statistics have been corrected, including addressing a backend caching issue. The default avatar display now correctly shows user initials with a consistent gray gradient background across the application when no custom avatar is uploaded. The immediate problem being addressed is the non-display of saved posts on the frontend.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles user authentication (login/register).
    -   **Changes**: Redesigned for a modern look, navigation logic updated to redirect to  instead of , and manual navigation removed to rely on .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Created to include .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes**: Created to include .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines FastAPI endpoints and backend logic.
    -   **Changes**:  and  endpoints updated to consistently use . A  function was added and integrated into follow/unfollow operations to invalidate the  cache.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB schema.
    -   **Changes**: The  model was updated to use  instead of  for consistency across the codebase.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Renders individual poll cards in the main feed, including author avatars and follow buttons.
    -   **Changes**: Ensured  consistently uses UUIDs.  from  was added to  dependencies to force re-renders upon follow state changes. Avatar rendering logic was modified to use  (initials) for   and its gradient style was harmonized with .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages the global state related to user following/unfollowing, including  status and .
    -   **Changes**: Internal logic was refined to better synchronize local follow state after actions, reducing reliance on potentially cached backend  calls.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A reusable component for displaying polls, likely used in other parts of the app like explore pages.
    -   **Changes**: Experienced corruption during attempted edits; restored to a functional state. The specific avatar rendering fix for   was applied to this file.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides methods for frontend to interact with backend poll-related APIs.
    -   **Changes**: The  method was corrected to use the right backend endpoint, , by passing the current user's ID.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's concern that saved posts were not appearing in the profile section, despite being successfully saved. The investigation focused on the frontend's interaction with the backend's saved posts functionality.
The key finding was that the  method in  was making an API call to an incorrect endpoint (). The backend actually exposes the saved polls at .
The AI engineer corrected the  method in  to correctly construct the URL using  (Chat 372).
Subsequent backend testing confirmed that the save and retrieve operations for polls are working perfectly at the API level (Chat 383). The trajectory concludes with the explicit statement that El problema ahora está **solo en el frontend**. El del ahora está usando el endpoint correcto, pero el ProfilePage no está mostrando las publicaciones guardadas. The current state is that the backend logic and API calls from the  are correct, but the  component itself is not rendering the fetched saved polls.

<optional_next_step>
Test the frontend to verify that the ProfilePage correctly displays the saved publications.
