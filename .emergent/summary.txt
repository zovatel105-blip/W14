The previous AI engineer initiated work to add a Panel de Compartición Social Rápida to the VotaTok application. Initially misinterpreted as a sharing feature, it was clarified by the user to be a social link *configuration* panel. The engineer implemented this, including dynamic addition of links with custom names, persistent storage in MongoDB via FastAPI, and a React frontend for display and editing.

A significant portion of the trajectory involved troubleshooting persistent Network connection failed and authentication issues. The AI leveraged the troubleshoot_agent, identified environment variable handling problems, and eventually resolved backend connectivity. Despite these fixes, frontend session persistence remained problematic.

The social links feature evolved from a simple list to a dynamic, user-customizable input form, then to visually appealing, clickable buttons, mirroring user feedback and a reference image. The primary challenge was ensuring frontend state updates and correct data rendering after save operations. The feature is now confirmed working by the user. The current task is to investigate a new User not found error when viewing profiles from the feed.

The core requirement was to add a Panel de Compartición Social Rápida to the user's profile page, specifically after the menciones (mentions) section.
Initial interpretation: A panel for quickly sharing the user's current profile on various social platforms (Behance, TikTok, My Website), using a universal share icon, to boost engagement and visibility.
Refined requirement (User clarification): The panel is for **adding and configuring personal social media links** (e.g., Behance URL, TikTok URL) to the user's profile, not for sharing the profile itself. This implies a form-based input system.
Further refinements:
-   Change the tab icon from share to chain (Link icon) to better represent links.
-   Implement a dynamic design with a **+ button to add new social links**, rather than a fixed list.
-   Allow users to **add custom names** for social platforms/websites, not just pre-defined options.
-   Ensure saved social links appear **below the + button**, not at the top of the profile page.
-   Display saved links as **attractive, clickable buttons/cards** (similar to a reference image), not as editable input fields, with delete functionality on hover.
-   Ensure links are **persistently saved and loaded correctly**, and that the frontend updates visually after saving.
Current State: The social links panel is implemented, allowing users to add custom social media links that appear as clickable buttons in a dedicated tab on their profile. The links persist, and the frontend updates correctly.

    -   **Summary**: This is the main React component for the user profile page. It manages the display of user information, various tabs (posts, likes, mentions, saved), and now the Social Links panel. It handles frontend logic for adding, editing, saving, and displaying social links.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Initial addition of a Social tab with  icon (later changed to  icon).
        -   Implementation of  for  to manage the list of social media entries.
        -    hooks to load social links from the backend on component mount.
        -   Functions , ,  for managing social link data locally and interacting with the backend.
        -   Rendering logic for a modal to add new social links with custom names and URLs.
        -   Conditional rendering to display social links as editable inputs for the profile owner and as read-only clickable buttons/cards for visitors.
        -   Validation logic for social link inputs.
        -   Error correction for filtering/rendering saved links.
        -   Styling adjustments to display links as colorful buttons/cards with delete functionality.
        -   Order correction to place the Add social network button above the list of saved links.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB document structure.
    -   **Changes**: Added  and  models to represent individual social links (name, URL, color) and a collection of these links associated with a user.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: The FastAPI application defining all backend API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Added new API endpoints:
        -   : To save a user's social links.
        -   : To retrieve the authenticated user's social links.
        -   : To retrieve social links for a specific user ID.
        -   Added  import for use in models.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment-specific variables for the frontend application.
    -   **Changes**: Created and repeatedly updated  to ensure it points to  for proper backend communication, resolving network connectivity issues.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: Centralized frontend configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Temporarily hardcoded  to  to troubleshoot environment variable issues. Later added specific endpoints for social links.

-   :
    -   **Summary**: A utility script to populate the database with test users.
    -   **Changes**: Executed to ensure  and other test users exist for authentication testing.

<current_work>
The immediate work was focused on the Social Sharing Panel feature. The AI engineer successfully implemented a dynamic social media link management system on the profile page. Users can now add custom social platform names and URLs via a + button, which appear as aesthetically pleasing, clickable buttons/cards. These links are stored persistently in MongoDB via new FastAPI endpoints. The feature includes a read-only view for visitors.

Throughout this implementation, significant effort was dedicated to resolving persistent Network connection failed issues, primarily stemming from incorrect  configuration in the frontend's environment and its interaction with the supervisor. This was eventually fixed by ensuring the frontend correctly uses  for backend API calls. Authentication session persistence also posed challenges, frequently redirecting to the login page.

The social links feature is now confirmed by the user to be working as expected, with links saving, loading, and displaying correctly (as colorful buttons below the add button).
